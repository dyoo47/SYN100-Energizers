      Hello! We are the Energizers, a group of students studying at UC San Diego that are passionate about
      helping to teaching others about potential solutions to the climate crisis. This is why we have designed
      this website as a project for the Synthesis program at our school. Our goal is to help spread awareness 
      of the severity of pollution and climate change in the energy sector, and to educate people on the pros
      and cons of each popular type of energy in use today, so people can make informed and educated decisions 
      about their potential use in the future. We aim for this information/curriculum to be used by teachers to allow 
      for them to more easily teach their students about the climate crisis using factual evidence from trusted sources,
      but not requiring as much time as it might take to individually analyze each of the sources. We also hope that this information 
      that we are sharing is able to inspire others to become interested in climate change so that we are able to reduce 
      its disasterous affects on our planet, and ultimately help those that are being dispropotionately affected by the 
      effects climate change has had and continues to have on our planet!
